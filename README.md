- 👋 Hi, I’m @KAuser2094 (Or Kastel usually on other websites)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... ?
- 🌴 I've currently learnt ... Python (+ Django), Lua, some C#/Java, basic C/C++ and very rudimentary JS (I don't like JS -_-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Improving Lua and Django, possible JS (still don't like it).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything and nothing. (Ok with anything if it comes, looking for nothing in particular)
- 📫 How to reach me ... no.
